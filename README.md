# 📰 Fake News Detection System

A lightweight, browser-based tool that detects likely fake news content using keyword-based analysis powered by core data structures like arrays and hash tables.

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **rule-based fake news detector** that scans news headlines or short articles and classifies them as either **Likely FAKE** or **Likely REAL** based on the presence of suspicious keywords. It highlights the flagged words and gives instant feedback to the user — all in a clean, responsive interface with light/dark theme support.

> ⚠️ This is a demonstration/educational tool. It does **not** use machine learning or external APIs, and it is **not** suitable for real-world journalistic decisions.
